These are my favorite workout shorts, and I can’t just get enough of them. I first started wearing Lululemon to work out in 2014 and since then have bought at least 3 or 4 pairs of these a year, all of which have stood the test of time. Love my pace breakers!
these are my favorite shorts from lulu I have 5 pair!
Perfect short for any sweaty pursuit!
Avery comfortable and functional short. The pockets help keep AirPods and keys intact.
Love the color and the fit. I wish they made more !!
Awesome shorts for any occasion / activity. These are personal favorite now.
Cozy, excellent build! Useful side zipped pocket and inner pockets on front. Wear them everyday
As always high quality product that is great for working out in or relaxing in. Shorts are breathable like all lululemon products. Well worth the price.
bought these and bearbottom shorts at the same time. bearbottoms were way better especially at 5.5" inseam. The material of these seem solid and durable, so it's better than other active wear shorts that i've bought.
Perfect fit for me and comfortable!. I wear these at the gym and for just walking around…
Great color and sizing, perfect length hitting right above the knee
Very disappointed there were no reviews on the shorts so I just went with what size the model was wearing. Extremely misleading and now I’m stuck with nonreturnable item.
Great shorts, highly recommend for comfort and activity.
Every man should own a pair of these shorts! Great fit, durable, great for working out or lounging!
Great shorts! Got these on sale and they're great for both casual wear and working out
I bought these for running and jogging, but after one use they're already coming undone at the seams near the bottom of the short. It is a very delicate fabric that seems to not sustain much resistance or pressure before starting to unthread. Careful if you're going to use these for strenuous activity
